# Todo App - Sample
This is a sample todo app, made with an Adonis.js backend and a Vue.js frontend.
The app is a simple todo list, where you can add, edit and delete todos. You can also mark todos as completed. It has a simple login system, where you can register a new user, and login with an existing user.

This is not a real app, it's only a work sample, to learn Adonis.js and try to use Vue.js at the same time.
Feel free to use it as you like.
